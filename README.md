# 🧪 EDA of Titanic Dataset with Python

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic Titanic dataset using Python libraries like **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic passenger dataset, which includes details such as age, gender, class, and whether the passenger survived the disaster.

- Source: [Seaborn's built-in Titanic dataset] or local CSV (`train.csv`)
- Rows: ~891
- Features: Name, Age, Sex, Class, Fare, Survived, etc.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

1. Load and explore the Titanic dataset  
2. Understand the structure using `.info()` and `.describe()`  
3. Visualize key variables to uncover insights
